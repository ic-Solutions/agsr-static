- title: Retirement Advocacy
  description:
    - In a country where social "welfarism" is uncommon and very meager for aged and the in-form, retirement planning becomes increasingly important.
    - Our experience of caring for infirm elderly for last two decades, we inferred that retirement fails due to non-financial reasons, mostly due to filial dysfunction, chronic diseases, spouse loss, and many more aspects faced by elderly those are filial, societial and health care issues.
    - In many cases, due to increased longevity young retires in their 60s are burdened with the responsibilities of caring for their infirm elderly parents those are in the very old category. Thus, early planning is essential for a secure retirement.
    - We see retirement as an ongoing process of exploration and change into a phase of "new beginnings" for the next 30 years or so. We conduct pre-retirement sessions for those who are entering retirement years, helping them accept, understand and plan retirement for what it really represents.
    - Retirement planning is not akin to financial planning, we help the young retirees to plan prepare and not get caught unawares with the multi-fold uncertainties of retirement, rather Retirement is an opportunity to plan, enjoy the leisure of time and set new goals for the rest and best years of your life.

    - “As long as there is heart-beat, there is hope”, for the first time in the country we have started coma care which emphasis care for the patient’s in coma. - When patients are discharged from hospitals into the community, there is very merger support systems to care for these patients as most families are novice in caring, their houses being totally uncontrolled achieving optimum care for patient whose life is controlled with life sustaining interventions is impossible.

- title: Continuum Competency
  description:
    - As part of our strategy to give impetus to the social gerontology education in India, we undertake Continuing Competency program for health care workers especially for Nurses (CCN) which is a five part series. The CCN series is similar to that of Guided Care Nursing.
    - In this regard, we are supported and guided by our team of experts from USA, Ms. Judith Parnes (Elderlife Management, NJ) and Dr.Ibby Tanner (Formerly Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore).
    - Developed by Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Guided Care represents a new kind of health care delivery model that represents our deep interest in discovering new ways to bring higher quality primary care to older adults in a more cost effective way. From our past experience we have inferred that guided care nursing has many benefits.
    - It improves the quality of patient’s care, reduces the use and cost of expensive services, lessens family caregiver strain, and finally, improves physicians’ satisfaction with chronic care.
    - This series of lectures that involve these useful topics, will help nurses prepare to take care of the chronically ill patient, and more specifically providing quality health care services to the aging population and their families.
- title: Research Studies
  description:
    - We carry out several Social Gerontological studies to understand the growing older population and its impact on society at large in terms of, health care, finances, interpersonal relationships, filial piety ete. Studies are conducted to understand the specific problem faced by the older adults and their families and we design the solution to tackle the problem.
    - To make the country future ready to address the upcoming challenges of burgeoning older population research studies are paramount. Among the studies we conducted few are "The young generation's perception on the elderly and on  the services for the elderly in Mangalore". This was a joint study with the School of Social Work, Roshni Nilaya, Mangalore, to understand the, willingness and mindset of younger generation.
    - Another study was conducted to find the influence of Ageism on nursing practice. Ultimate aim was to find the nurse's knowledge, willingness and future intentions to work with older adults.
